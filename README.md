🔐 Introduction to Information Security Labs & Projects
This section highlights my hands-on experience in Intro to Information Security, where I developed a strong foundation in Linux, networking, and security tools through a series of structured labs and a public education project.

🧾 Lab 1: Linux Basics – Shell & Nix Commands
Purpose: Introduction to Linux and essential shell commands

Navigated the Linux file system using the terminal

Practiced common nix commands such as ls, cd, mkdir, chmod, and man

Gained comfort working in a CLI environment, a critical skill for cybersecurity tasks

🌐 Lab 2: Networking Basics
Purpose: Understand ARP, ping, and TCP/IP fundamentals

Used tools like arp, ping, and ifconfig to explore basic network configurations

Investigated how devices communicate using the TCP/IP model

Learned how to identify MAC and IP address mappings and interpret network traffic

🔓 Lab 3: Telnet vs SSH
Purpose: Explore the risks of plaintext protocols and the importance of encryption

Connected to a remote computer using Telnet to observe insecure data transmission

Captured and analyzed plaintext passwords using tcpdump

Repeated the process using SSH to demonstrate how encrypted communication secures credentials

🕵️ Identity Theft Awareness Project
Purpose: Educate the public on online threats and how to stay safe

Created an informative presentation or resource on identity theft

Explained common methods attackers use (phishing, social engineering, data breaches)

Offered practical tips for protection such as strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and safe browsing habits

These labs built a strong foundation for my cybersecurity journey, covering essential concepts in system security, networking, and secure communications.
